 * - **Stateful across deltas.** A tag may arrive SPLIT across wire chunks (`'<thi'`
 *   ending one delta, `'nk>'` opening the next) — `split` holds any ambiguous tail
 *   back until the next delta (or `flush`) disambiguates it, so a partial tag is
 *   never leaked as content and never mis-eaten as thinking.
 * - **`split(delta)`** feeds one raw content delta and returns the CLEAN content to
 *   surface for it (possibly `''` — e.g. mid-think). Text inside a
 *   `<think>…</think>` span accumulates on `thinking`; multiple spans accumulate in
 *   order; a nested-looking `<think>` inside an open span is just thinking text (no
 *   nesting — the first `</think>` closes).
 * - **The IMPLICIT leading open (the qwen3-template shape).** Some chat templates
 *   PRE-SEED `<think>` into the prompt scaffold, so the wire stream begins
 *   MID-REASONING and only a bare `</think>` ever appears. Before any tag event, a
 *   bare close therefore RECLASSIFIES everything surfaced so far (plus the pre-close
 *   pending) as thinking — `content` is corrected retroactively, while the already
 *   `split`-returned prefix cannot be recalled (the one shape where the per-delta
 *   returns over-report; `content` stays authoritative). The rule is ONE-SHOT: after
 *   any tag event a bare `</think>` is plain text (prose quoting the tag stays text).
 * - **`flush()`** settles the stream end: an UNCLOSED `<think>` tail (the model was
 *   cut off mid-reasoning) lands on `thinking`; a held partial tag that never
 *   completed (`'<thi'` then EOF) is returned as the final clean-content delta —
 *   it was real text after all.
 * - **`content` / `thinking`** are the authoritative accumulations so far (read them
 *   after the stream — or mid-stream for a cancel's partial); `content` is the ONE
 *   exact clean-content source (the per-delta returns match it except across an

	 *   — i.e. **item override > manager-options override > provider default > built-in**.
	 *   Again `M.format(I)` already returns the options override when set, else the
	 *   built-in, so `build()` layers the per-item `I.format` ON TOP and the provider
	 *   default BETWEEN.

 *
 * Observation is provably side-effect-free on the loop: listener isolation is the emitter's
 * (§13) — every event is emitted directly and a listener throw is routed to the emitter's OWN
 * `error` handler (the `error` option), never onto this domain map and never into the

 * provider-agnostic {@link ConversationSummarizer} seam.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - **Live tail + sections.** The conversation OWNS its LIVE uncompacted tail DIRECTLY — a
 *   caller appends turns through its own message verbs (`add` mints each `id`, `message` /
 *   `messages` look up, `remove` / `clear` drop, `count` tallies), exactly as a `Workspace`
 *   owns its files (no separate per-value manager). `sections` are the compacted history
 *   (oldest → newest), each a summarized slice that RETAINS its originals. `summary` is the
 *   conversation rollup (a summary-of-summaries over all sections), regenerated on each
 *   compaction (`undefined` until the first compaction).
 * - **Message verbs (the inlined store).** `add` takes one {@link MessageInput} or a batch
 *   (§9.2), MINTS each message's `id` (a random UUID), stores it, and returns the created
 *   message(s); a stored message is immutable. `message(id)` resolves one (`undefined` when
 *   absent); `messages()` lists the live tail in insertion order; `remove` drops one by id or
 *   a batch (§9.2); `clear` empties the tail; `count` is how many live messages are stored.
 * - **`view()` — the model input.** Each section folds to ONE synthetic summary message,
 *   followed by the live messages verbatim: `[...sections-as-summary-messages, ...live]`. The
 *   rollup `summary` is NOT injected (it is a separately pull-able digest for a
 *   cross-conversation case); `view()` carries the per-section summaries, which ARE the
 *   compaction benefit.
 * - **`compact()` — fold older live → a section.** Folds the oldest `count - keep` live
 *   messages into a new {@link SectionInterface} (its `summary` from `summarize`), removes
 *   them from the live tail, REGENERATES the rollup (a second `summarize` over all section
 *   summaries), and emits `summary` then `compact` — returning the new section (or
 *   `undefined` when nothing folds). TWO summarizer calls per compaction (the section digest
 *   + the rollup). Throws a {@link import('./errors.js').ConversationError} when no
 *   `summarize` was supplied.
 * - **`summarizable` — whether a `compact()` CAN fold.** `true` when a
 *   {@link ConversationSummarizer} was supplied, `false` otherwise. The agent loop's AUTOMATIC
 *   compaction (`AgentOptions.window`) gates on it so a conversation that has no summarizer is
 *   never auto-compacted (and the loop never throws the `compact()` `SUMMARIZER` error from the
 *   auto path). A MANUAL `compact()` still throws without a summarizer — only the auto path is
 *   guarded.
 * - **`rehydrate(id)` / `search(query)` — read the retained originals.** `rehydrate` returns
 *   a section's full original messages (`[]` for an unknown id) and emits `rehydrate` — a
 *   pure READ (the caller decides whether to re-add them; v1 never auto-reinserts).
 *   `search` is a case-insensitive substring scan of `content` across ALL messages (every
 *   section's originals + the live tail).
 * - **`reference(options?)` — pull THIS conversation into ANOTHER with provenance.** A PURE
 *   string render (no model call) of a self-labeled, fenced cross-conversation block — the
 *   rollup `summary` (when included + present) plus cherry-picked excerpts — framed so a small

 * — a {@link WorkspaceManagerInterface} reads a snapshot back and rebuilds the live workspace
 * through the constructor `seed` (see {@link WorkspaceManagerInterface.open} /

 *

 * - **Active pointer.** `active` is the active workspace (what the context renders), `undefined`
 *   until the FIRST `add` (which auto-activates it). A later `add` leaves `active` unchanged.
